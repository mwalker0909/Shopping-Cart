# Shopping-Cart
Holly and Mason

Holly and I worked very well together on this assignment. Both of us have contributed quite a fair bit of code and ideas for shopping-cart. Unfortunately, we have both gone around and around attemptinig to get the button to function and remove the items as intended. It will occsionally work properly a few times, then break. I have run out of time and am okay losing 1 point here but I have to admit we both have learned a lot. I think one thing we agree on is sometimes we have to sacraifice functionality to finish the project. Everything can't be perfect, it just has to be good enough. I realize that in the real world, the project functionality is everything. The thing must work! Here we only lost 1 point (I would imagine) so this is acceptable to us. The part that is imperative is that we have learned something and we can take something away from this lesson for next time. 
I believe we have spent ~ 8-10 hours on this and greatly feel our other assignments are more important at this moment than Shopping cart is to finish. Holly has been a fantastic partner. We are both happy enough about this project, and I hope we are paired up again in the future (with more time to work together on issues in class)!
